      <h2>Signal Hill</h2>
      <img class="thingImg" src="images/signal_hill.jpg">
      <p>Stand atop Signal Hill and let your soul be stirred by the crack of muskets and the roar of cannon fire. Discover the story of how British and French soldiers battled fiercely to control this strategic location. Explore the iconic Cabot Tower and experience a view of St. John's and the North Atlantic that is truly spectacular.

      <h2>Cape Spear</h2>

      <img class="thingImg" src="images/cape-spear-sunrise.jpg">
      <p>If you stand here, your back to the sea, the entire population of North America stretches out in front of you. And there’s nothing behind you until Ireland. <br><br>

Perched on a rugged cliff, at our continent’s most easterly point, sits Cape Spear Lighthouse – the oldest surviving lighthouse in the province, a National Historic Site, and an iconic symbol of Newfoundland and Labrador's marine history.
