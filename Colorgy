<h1>Colorgy</h1>


<h2>Difficulty and Modal Levels</h2>
<p>I am quite happy that Colorgy ended up with such a wide range of difficulty.
  There are extremely simple puzzles and puzzles that still take me quite awhile to crack.



<h2>Music</h2>
<p>I put a great deal of thought into the music in Colorgy.
  On the one hand, I felt a puzzle game should have somewhat minimal music, nothing that would distract the player from the task at hand.
  And nothing too repetative that would grate on the player's nerves.
  <p>I decided I wanted to do something dynamic, something that synced with the player's actions and tied in with the game mechanics themselves.
    <p>(Music Theory Alert) I decided to have each gameplay action would have a chord assigned to it.
      Clearing hexes with the nova played a maj9 chord.
      Absorbing colors with the cube nova plays an augmented chord.
      Adding color with the diamond plays a suspened 4 chord.
      The vortex plays a chord made from the hexatonic scale.
      I felt the flavor or character of each chord reflected the accociated gameplay action.
      The vortex and the diamond can never be used to finish a level, so it is appropiate that they have an unresolved nature to them.

      <p>Rather than repeat those same chords everytime, the voicing of the chord would be higher and higher as the level progresses,
        building to a nice sense of cadence and completion.



<h2>What I would do differently</h2>

<h3>Agile</h3>
<p>If I was to do this project again, I would make sure to begin teting with users as soon as posible.
  A few users commented that the cube and diamond system was confusing and that plus and minus would have been much more intuative.
  Though I feel plus and minus signs would be somewhat gaudy in a game like this, I have to admit they have a good point.
  Cube and diamonds made sense to me as the creator of the game, but

  <h3>Too easy, too hard</h3>
  <p>It is imposible to please everybody, initial feedback I recieved from the gaming comunity was that the difficult puzzles were really great, but it took too long to get to them.
    On the flip side, when testing with people less familar with games, they needed more tutorialising.
    If I could re-do this, I would have a less linera nature to the game and allow the user to attempt the more difficult levels right away.
    Another issue is the the vortex, one of the most interesting pieces in the game, doesn't make an apperance until mid way through the game.
    This was diliberate, as the vortex puzzles are some of the most difficult and disorienting, but having it in the middle fails to show case it to a casual player.

    <h3>What was the color wheel again...</h3>
    <p>As I worked on colorgy, I became very familar with the color wheel and which two colors make what.
      I found for a lot of players, this was not always obvious or intuative.
      To further confuse things, many people are used to RGB color values rather than the red-blue-yellow system I was using.
      <p>In future I would add additional visual queses to differentiate between primary and secondary colors,
        perhaps having a different texture for each (smooth crystal for one and jagged ore for the other).
